## General info

An RPG item generator. The items have chance to upgrade ("Titanforge"), howerer, if the item upgrades, another upgrade has lower chance to happen. For example: there is 50% chance for the first upgrade, then 46%, then 42%, down to 10% for max upgrade.
When I saw this system to be used in World of Warcraft, I really liked it and always wanted to try to make my own, to check out the algorithm.
